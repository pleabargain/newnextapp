This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Software Requirements

### API Key Management System - Requirements Gathering

Q&A Process for CRUD Implementation:

1. What type of API keys should be supported?
   - Answer: UUID (Universally Unique Identifiers)
   - Rationale: UUIDs provide guaranteed uniqueness, are widely supported, and are suitable for API key generation
   - Implementation: Will use crypto.randomUUID() for generation

2. What metadata should be stored with each API key?
   - Answer: Selected fields:
     - Key name/description (existing)
     - Creation date (existing)
     - Last used date (existing)
     - Expiration date (new)
     - Usage limits (new)
     - Status (active/revoked) (new)
   - Implementation Notes:
     - Expiration date: ISO 8601 format, optional field
     - Usage limits: Number of requests per time period
     - Status: Boolean flag for active/revoked state

3. How should API keys be stored and secured?
   - Answer: SQL Database
   - Rationale: 
     - Structured data with relationships
     - ACID compliance for data integrity
     - Better for complex queries and reporting
     - Built-in support for transactions
   - Implementation Notes:
     - Will use Prisma ORM for database operations
     - Schema will include API keys table with all required fields
     - Will implement proper indexing for performance

4. What API endpoints should be implemented for CRUD operations?
   - Answer: Basic CRUD endpoints
   - Implementation:
     - GET /api/keys - List all API keys
     - GET /api/keys/:id - Get single API key
     - POST /api/keys - Create new API key
     - PUT /api/keys/:id - Update API key
     - DELETE /api/keys/:id - Delete API key
   - Notes:
     - All endpoints will be RESTful
     - Will implement proper error handling
     - Will add input validation
     - Will follow Next.js API route conventions

5. What validation and error handling should be implemented?
   - Answer: Selected requirements:
     - Input validation rules
     - Error response formats
     - HTTP status codes
   - Implementation Details:
     - Input Validation:
       - Required fields: name, expiration date
       - Format validation for dates (ISO 8601)
       - Length limits for name field
     - Error Response Format:
       ```json
       {
         "error": {
           "code": "string",
           "message": "string",
           "details": "object"
         }
       }
       ```
     - HTTP Status Codes:
       - 200: Success
       - 201: Created
       - 400: Bad Request
       - 404: Not Found
       - 500: Server Error

6. What UI components and features should be implemented?
   - Answer: Selected components:
     - Key details view
     - Edit/Delete modals
     - Confirmation dialogs
   - Implementation Details:
     - Key Details View:
       - Show all key metadata
       - Copy key to clipboard
       - View usage history
     - Edit/Delete Modals:
       - Form validation
       - Error handling
       - Success feedback
     - Confirmation Dialogs:
       - Delete confirmation
       - Revoke key confirmation
       - Unsaved changes warning

### UI Specifications

#### General Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Prioritize high-contrast text colors: black text on white/light backgrounds, and white text on dark backgrounds.
- Avoid using `text-gray` classes when a high-contrast alternative (black or white) is appropriate.

#### Dashboard Page (`http://localhost:3000/dashboards`)
- **Main Heading**: "API Keys Management" (text-white).
- **Create New API Key Section (background: gray-50)**:
  - Subheading: "Create New API Key" (text-black).
  - Input Field: "Enter API Key Name" placeholder.
  - "Generate Key" Button: (background: indigo-600, text-white).
  - "Cancel" Button: (background: gray-200, text-black).
- **API Key List (background: white)**:
  - API Key Name (`h3`): (text-black).
  - Created and Last Used Dates (`p`): (text-black).
  - "No API keys found" message: (text-black).

#### Component-Specific Guidelines
- All buttons should have `tabindex="0"`, `aria-label`, `onClick`, and `onKeyDown` attributes for accessibility.
- Use `const` for functions (e.g., `const handleClick = () => {}`).
- Implement early returns for improved readability.

### Implementation Plan

#### API-First Development Approach
- Why API First?
  - Defines clear contract between frontend and backend
  - Enables parallel development
  - Facilitates testing and documentation
  - Allows for multiple client implementations
  - Makes the system more maintainable and scalable

#### Implementation Steps

1. API Implementation (Current Focus)
   - Create API routes structure
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add validation middleware
   - Set up error handling
   - Document API endpoints

2. Database Setup
   - Install Prisma
   - Define schema
   - Set up migrations

3. UI Implementation
   - Enhance existing components
   - Add new components
   - Implement state management

4. Testing
   - Unit tests for API endpoints:
     - GET /api/keys
       - List all keys
       - Handle empty state
       - Error handling
     - POST /api/keys
       - Create new key
       - Validate input
       - Error handling
     - GET /api/keys/[id]
       - Get single key
       - Handle not found

## Getting Started

Run the following command to install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd newnextapp && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To access the API Key Management Dashboard, visit [http://localhost:3000/dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards). If port 3000 is in use, check the terminal output for an alternative port (e.g., http://localhost:3001/dashboards).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Important Considerations for CRUD and APIs

Implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, especially when involving APIs and databases, is inherently complex. This project demonstrates some of these challenges:

- **APIs are Hard**: Designing robust and error-resistant API endpoints requires careful consideration of request/response formats, validation, and error handling for various scenarios.
- **Databases are Hard**: Setting up and integrating a persistent database (like SQLite with Prisma, as used here) involves schema definition, migrations, and proper client initialization to ensure data consistency and availability. In-memory solutions, while useful for quick prototypes, do not persist data across server restarts.
- **LLM Promises vs. Reality**: While Large Language Models can assist in generating code, they often miss crucial environmental nuances, integration complexities, and best practices (like proper database client instantiation for persistent connections). Relying solely on LLMs for complex application logic like CRUD operations can lead to unexpected errors, data loss in non-persistent setups, and a significant debugging overhead. It is critical to understand the underlying technologies and verify LLM-generated code thoroughly.
